# LeNet

LeNet is a small deep neural network used to teach the basic of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). This architecture was first introduced by [LeCun etal](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).

# Dataset

In this project we will use [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

# Framework

In this project will be used Keras with backend Tensorflow.

# Usage

Run code:
```sh
$  python lenet_mnist.py
```

# Reference
This code was obtained from book "Deep Learning for Compution Vision".
